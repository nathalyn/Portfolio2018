          <section class="case-text"><h2 class="case-subtitle">Overview</h2>
            <p>During freshman year in college, I started freelancing as an editorial makeup artist just to make some extra cash, but after working in the beauty services industry for some time I saw an opportunity to solve a problem that everyday people have when booking a beauty professional. My co-founder and I founded POSH, an easy and reliable way for people to book a beauty pro. </p>
            </section>

          <!-- <section class="case-text">
            <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Problem</h2>
              <p>We decided to examine some pain-points for our customer.
                  As a beauty freelancer, common challenges include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Getting clients</li>
                    <li>Managing awkward payments </li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                  </ul>
              <p>And as a person who pays a freelancer you might:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Spend time searching for a good contractor</li>
                     <li>Deal with late arrivals/nonprofessionalism on the job</li>
                     <li>Anxiety about dealing with a stranger</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2 class="case-subtitle">My Role</h2>
                  <p>As a founder I did a variety of tasks, but some of the key things in product design include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>UI/UX wireframes and mapping</li>

            <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>
              <p>Going into this we had a good amount of assumptions about what clients valued based on my freelancing experience, but we later confirmed and rejected certain assumptions based on new experiences with POSH and customer research. </p>
                <p class="bold">Who's our customer?</p>
                <p>Based on the gigs we had at the time, we knew a good amount of money we made came commercial clients, mainly two streams:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> Fashion industry professionals - photographers, designers, models, etc</li>
                    <li> Event planners/wedding planners </li>
                  </ul>
              <p class="bold">What we thought clients wanted:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Shorter communication time with artists</li>
                     <li>A cool tech experience to make booking professionals fun</li>
                     <li>Pro-looking seating/lighting set-up for their service</li>

                  </section>
              <p class="bold">What We Learned:</p>
              <p>After interviewing several individuals in DC metro area about their experiences in their work and beauty services, we found some of our main assumptions didn't really matter. Most individuals in the fashion/event space mentioned that:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Timing and reliability is everything -</span> They have tight schedules and late arrivals/no shows reflects badly on them</li>
                <li><span class="bold">They have a 'list' -</span> building relationships with trusted partners helps them deliver quality to their clients quickly</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Micromanaging is annoying-</span> the best experiences come when they can focus on their job, not someone else's</li>
                </ul>
              <p>We thought tech and features were important but soon realized we needed to spend time on the "people" aspect of our business while maintaining a simple but reassuring presence online. </p>
                </section>

          <section class="case-text">
            <h2 class="case-subtitle">Developing the Brand</h2>
              <p>Now we had a better understanding of our customer, we narrowed it further by branching to a particular part of the market we knew we had success with in the past and was more likely to pull in. Our customers are often in the fashion/event space, often producing modern work and catering to younger audiences. </p>
              <p class="bold">Key characteristics of our customer:</p>
              <p>Based on the gigs we had at the time, we knew a good amount of money we made came commercial clients, mainly two streams:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Busy -</span> in many different places at once</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Artistic -</span> has some need for visual flair and taste</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">An organizer-</span> often makeup is only part of what they have to think abouts</li>
                    </ul>
              <p class="bold">Key characteristics the brand could complement them with</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Fast and easy</span></li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Trendy yet custom</span></li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Reliable</span></li>
                    </ul>
              </section>

          <section class="case-text">
              <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Logo</h2>
                <p>We chose a modern typographic logo that was <span class= "bold">bold yet minimum</span>. After slight kerning adjustments we thought it made a good fit - black and white coloring was what I chose to emphasize our brand as <span class= "bold">clean, professional and timeless</span>.
                  This was a good fit for our brand as <span class= "bold">our audience primarily wanted professional yet stylish work</span>. </p>
                <p>We primarily used the center iteration as black gave the brand a bit more edge (and is a beauty industry standard). This worked well for us as it gave us flexibility, and because it was very dynamic on different forms of branding and marketing material.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Other Branding Elements</h2>
                    <p>I implemented the same black white theme through out, while adding touches of hot pink to resonate with an audience that is <span class= "bold"> bold, modern, vibrant, and edgy</span>. While other companies in this space often use more light, muted, and pastel color schemes to appeal to a soft and expensive taste we believed our brand to be more <span class= "bold">trendy and shamelessly exciting</span>.
                      This was a good fit for our brand as <span class= "bold">our audience primarily wanted professional yet stylish work</span>. </p>

                <p>Some of the wireframes of the key pages are shown below. These were initial concepts I had for an ideal experience with our product.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Login Page -</span> The first part of what a client sees, essential for logging in to view their specific bookings.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">User Profile -</span> POSH matches artists based on user info/preferences, so having a central location for that is important. The star rating feature functions as an incentive for positive communication/feedback. The "Likes" feature is a way for users to keep tabs on looks they admire, and helps shape what they're preferences might be like.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Artist Profile -</span> To build trust from clients, there is Artist Profile so that clients can know a bit more about the artists at POSH. This not only includes a rating system but also a depiction of "Latest Work" so that clients are not only able to view artist style but also save looks they admire.</li>
                  </ul>

                        <li><span class="bold">Community -</span> To establish more transparency and build trust there is a community page where users can see different bookings in their community, learn more about artists and view work.

                <p>To give artists more credibility from the perspective of the user, An 'Artist Profile' with name, location and overall rating is provided. Ideally we give minimum information about our artists outside of booking, but here we give just enough for users to get the gist.
                  Users have the option to see their work, and if they like them enough to an o work with them in future, they can add the artists to 'Favorites'. This also plays a role in customizing the client's experience. </p>

                            <p>In the end we stuck with our branding concepts and implemented them throughout our company.
                              After operating through our MVP stage for a while (which was a website and form), we learned that:
                            <ul>
                               <li><span class="bold">Scheduling is more of a painpoint than preferences -</span> We later found that scheduling and logistics took majority of the customers time when using the product and can often be the most tedious.</li>
                               <li><span class="bold">Design for future use - </span>Customers would sometimes need reminders or details for future appointments. Designing a flow for confirmation might have been able to help provide this clarity.</li>
                               <li><span class="bold">Question assumptions at every stage -</span> We made assumptions about customer needs at the beginning of the design and throughout. Not getting too attached to them allows
                                    for broader thinking on how to achieve user goals better and allows for easier pivot.</li>
