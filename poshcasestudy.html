            <p>During freshman year in college, I started freelancing as an editorial makeup artist just to make some extra cash, but after working in the beauty services industry for some time I saw an opportunity to solve a problem that everyday people have when booking a beauty  professional. My co-founder and I founded POSH, the easiest and most reliable way for anyone to book a beauty pro. </p>

          <section class="case-text">
            <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Problem</h2>
              <p>You probably have an idea of what it's like to be a freelancer or work with one.
                  As a beauty freelancer, common challenges include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Getting clients</li>
                    <li>Managing awkward payments </li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                  </ul>
              <p>And as a person who pays a freelancer you might:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Spend time searching for a good contractor</li>
                     <li>Deal with late arrivals/nonprofessionalism on the job</li>
                     <li>Anxiety about dealing with a stranger</li>
                    </ul>

                      <p>The beauty industry itself is fragmented and extremely personal, so my co-founder and I created POSH as the easiest and most reliable way for anyone to book a beauty professional. When clients go to our web app and fill out their details, POSH sends them a vetted artist custom select for their needs. And when they're done, that's it. They can leave a review.</p>

            <h2 class="case-subtitle">My Role</h2>
                  <p>As a founder I did a variety of tasks, but some of the key things in product design include:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>UI/UX wireframes and mapping</li>
                        <li>Customer/Contractor Research</li>
                        <li>Brand Identity</li>
                        <li>Hi-fi mock-ups</li>
                      </ul>
                  <p>Tools Used: Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, Figma, Adobe Experience Design</p>
                  </section>


          <section class="case-text">
            <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>
              <p>Going into this we had a good amount of assumptions about what clients valued based on my freelancing experience, but we later confirmed and rejected certain assumptions based on new experiences with POSH and customer research. </p>
                <h4>Who's our customer?</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Getting clients</li>
                    <li>Managing awkward payments </li>
                    <li>Communication</li>
                  </ul>

                     <li>Deal with late arrivals/nonprofessionalism on the job</li>
                     <li>Anxiety about dealing with a stranger</li>
