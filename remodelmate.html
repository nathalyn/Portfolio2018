                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">overview</h2>
                  <p>Remodelmate helps homeowners love where they live by connecting them with reliable, quality-driven contractors and
                      guiding and managing their project.
                      In November 2017, I joined the team to lead the product redesign and company rebrand to
                      make the product flow more intuitive, custom and cohesive.
                    </p>

                  <p>After speaking with Chad (founder) about the customer base, product milestones and company goals, we were able to
                    sort out challenges and possible solutions for the redesign.
                    </p>

                  </section> -->

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>
                  <p>Starting off we decided to interview past and current customers to get an idea of what users of the website and
                      believers in the brand would be like. We also conducted interviews with people who have thought about Remodelmate but changed their mind.
                      This allowed us to figure out what works, why it does and what gaps needed to be filled in the user flow.</p>
                      <h4 class="bold mini-subtitle">Who's our customer</h4>
                      <p>Our ideal user are people middle-aged or higher who either own a house, townhome or condo. After speaking with users, we found a couple of common painpoints:</p>
                          <ul>
                             <li>They don't have time to micromanage or attempt DIY major home projects.</li>
                             <li>They might be hesitant to trust contractors due past experiences of faulty work or incompleteness.</li>
                             <li>They needed more clarity of the project scope and Remodelmate's role.</li>
                            </ul>
                  <section>

                      </section>

                  <p>Based on these learnings and observations we decided to appraoch the design with clear communication, experiences to build trust
                      and ways for users to keep up with their project.</p>
                  <section>

                      </section>
                      <p>Lighter shading was applied to the upper arrow to give this mark dimensionality. I wanted to convey technology at the forefont of
                          the industry, so I chose to convey that with a bold overlay.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Final Designs</h2>
                  <p>The final logos include the mark to the upper right of the typeface, in light and dark variations. </p>

                  <p>While the mark and the typeface are used together for the official logo there are separate use-cases,
                    such as the mark being used for the app icon as shown below.
