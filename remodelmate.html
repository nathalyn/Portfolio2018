                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">overview</h2>
                  <p>Remodelmate helps homeowners love where they live by connecting them with reliable, quality-driven contractors and
                      guiding and managing their project.
                      In November 2017, I joined the team to lead the product redesign and company rebrand to
                      make the product flow more intuitive, custom and cohesive.
                    </p>

                  <p>After speaking with Chad (founder) about the customer base, product milestones and company goals, we were able to
                    sort out challenges and possible solutions for the redesign.
                    </p>

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>
                  <p>Starting off we decided to interview past and current customers to get an idea of what users of the website and
                      believers in the brand would be like. We also conducted interviews with people who have thought about Remodelmate but changed their mind.
                      This allowed us to figure out what works, why it does and what gaps needed to be filled in the user flow.</p>
                      <h4 class="bold mini-subtitle">Who's our customer</h4>
                      <p>Our ideal user are people middle-aged or higher who either own a house, townhome or condo. After speaking with users, we found a couple of common painpoints:</p>
                          <ul>
                             <li>They don't have time to micromanage or attempt DIY major home projects.</li>
                             <li>They might be hesitant to trust contractors due past experiences of faulty work or incompleteness.</li>
                             <li>They needed more clarity of the project scope and Remodelmate's role.</li>
                            </ul>
                  <section>
                        <img class="case-img" src="images/rmate-personas.png">
                      </section>

                  <p>Based on these learnings and observations we decided to appraoch the design with clear communication, experiences to build trust
                      and ways for users to keep up with their project.</p>
                      </section>

                <section class="case-text">
                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Brand Elements</h2>
                <p>We refined the color palette with a cool-toned green for an upbeat but professional primary color.
                    The original serif typeface used for the logo was switched out with a more modern and sleek sans serif.
                    We arranged the type in the logo, and used this type throughout the web layout.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Sketches</h2>
                  <p>I started off sketching rough ideas for a simple, easy-to-use and modern layout for the website.

                      <p>Having a clean and open layout was important for clarity and ease-of-use, we planned to
                          approach redesign to be as concise as possible.</p>
                            </section>

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">User Flows</h2>
                  <p>We broke down the process and how users interact with the product, starting from their initial search for
                      a contractor to project completion.</p>
                      <section>
                            <img class="case-img" src="images/rmate-user-flows.png">
                          </section>
                  <p>We also used the flows to find opportunities to improve usabilty and experience.
                      This included the 'Get Inspired' case-study feature as well as the Remodelmate 'Project Builder'.</p>
                        </section>


                <section class="case-text">
                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">Opening up to users with 'Get Inspired'</h2>
                    <p>We decided to increase transparency and build trust through an engaging experience of content -
                      featuring past client work done by Remodelmate before, complete with photos, videos,
                      time frames, pricing and contractor info. This was especially fitting as most customers
                      spoke of being pulled in by media content.
                      </p>

                      <p>The next main feature was the project builder. Using this feature customers can describe their project,
                          choose contractors within their budget and schedule and submit their request to begin renovating.
                          Users can see who's available and qualified for their needs instantly, as well as plan for multiple contractors.</p>

                        <p>Right now we're working on content strategy and designing a customer dashboard flow for users to manage their projects.
                           I'm also continuing to iterate on these designs we continue to understand user needs better.</p>
