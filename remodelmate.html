                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">overview</h2>
                  <p>Remodelmate helps homeowners love where they live by connecting them with reliable, quality-driven contractors and
                      guiding and managing their project.
                      In November 2017, I joined the team to lead the product redesign and company rebrand to
                      make the customer-facing product flow more intuitive, cohesive and ready for automation.
                    </p>

                  <p>After speaking with Chad (founder) about the customer base, product milestones and company goals, we were able to
                    sort out challenges and the main goal for the user:
                    </p>

                    <h4>How can we make the renovating process a transparent, approachable and frictionless experience? </h4>

                  </section> -->

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>
                  <p>Starting off we decided to interview past and current customers to get an idea of what users of the website and
                      believers in the brand would be like. We also conducted interviews with people who have thought about Remodelmate but changed their mind.
                      This allowed us to figure out what works, why it does and what gaps needed to be filled in the user flow.</p>
                      <h4 class="bold mini-subtitle">Who's our customer</h4>
                      <p>Our ideal user-base are people middle-aged or higher who either own a house, townhome or condo. After speaking with users, we found a couple of common painpoints:</p>
                          <ul>
                             <li>They don't have time to micromanage or attempt DIY major home projects.</li>
                             <li>They might be hesitant to trust contractors due past experiences of faulty work or incompleteness.</li>
                             <li>They needed more clarity of the project scope and Remodelmate's role.</li>
                            </ul>
                  <section>
                        <img class="case-img" src="images/rmate-personas.png">
                      </section>

                  <p>Based on these learnings and observations we decided to approach the design with <span class="bold">clear communication, experiences to build trust
                      and ways for users to keep up with their project.</span></p>
                      </section>

                <section class="case-text">
                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Brand Elements</h2>
                <p>One of the first things we worked on was refining the brand identity to compliment our target audience. We wanted to brand to be <span class="bold">clean, trustworthy and friendly</span>
                   as we found that customers within our target market were receptive to brand presences with those traits</pn>
                <p>We designed a color palette with a cool-toned green for an upbeat and professional primary color.
                    The original serif typeface used for the logo was switched out with a friendly and modern sans serif.
                    We kept the original mark of a house merged with a dog to reinforce that <span class="bold">friendly and loyal attitude</span>, and used the typeface throughout the rest of web layout
                    as it was both fitting to the brand a readable in copy.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Sketches</h2>
                  <p>I started off sketching rough ideas for a simple, easy-to-use and modern layout for the website.
                      </p>
                    <section>

                      </section>
                      <p>Having a clean and open layout was important for clarity and ease-of-use, we planned to
                          approach redesign to be as concise as possible to meet the user needs of fully understanding the product.</p>
                            </section>

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">User Flows</h2>
                  <p>We broke down the process and how users interact with the product, starting from their initial search for
                      a contractor to project completion.</p>
                      <section>

                          </section>
                  <p>We also used the flows to find opportunities to improve usabilty and experience.
                      This included the 'Get Inspired' case-study feature as well as the Remodelmate 'Project Builder'.</p>
                        </section>


                <section class="case-text">
                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">Opening up to users with 'Get Inspired'</h2>
                    <p>We decided to increase transparency and build trust through an engaging experience of content -
                      featuring past client work done by Remodelmate before, complete with photos, videos,
                      time frames, pricing and contractor info. This was especially fitting as most customers
                      spoke of being pulled in by media content.

                      <p>The next main feature was the project builder. Using this feature customers can describe their project,
                          choose contractors within their budget and schedule and submit their request to begin renovating.
                          Users can see who's available and qualified for their needs instantly, as well as plan for multiple contractors.</p>

                        <p>One critical challenge of the Project Builder was collecting information in a way that would
                            be relevant for the customer and contractor while keeping automation of the platform in mind.
                            We started off with a list of project details a customer inputs and narrowed it down to what was absolutely necessary for
                            contractors to generate a quote.
                            After several explorations we found that quantifying different jobs (at the right of the screen) would execute this well.</p>

                        </section>
                        <p>To remain flexible and customer-centric, we made it possible for customers to input other information to give specific
                          details to their chosen contractor.</p>

                          <h2 class="case-subtitle">What About Multiple Contractors?</h2>
                          <p>One problem we encountered in Project Builder was the flow a user would take when their project needs more than one contractor to complete
                              (this is especially true for larger projects like a full room or home). We took a 'step-by-step' approach to keep the user in sync, by first notifying the user
                              of a need for multiple contractors and allowing them to select their contractor for each part of the project.</p>

                                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Key Takeaways</h2>
                                <ul>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Don't sacrifice clarity for simplicity -</span> Several of the first iterations lacked descriptions or other indicators to let users what part of the process they were in or what they could do. This proved problematic
                                        as people who knew little about Remodelmate had trouble understanding context.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Design guidelines are a must -</span> This allowed for quicker iterations with reusable components and helped maintain consistency throughout the design.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Sync up with other parts of the product -</span> It was important that we asked questions about how the design would work well from the engineering side and the contractor
                                       side. Certain trade-offs were necessary (like choosing to standardize job types to make sure that we could still automate quote generation.)</li>

                                 </ul>

                        <p>Moving forward we're continuing to ask questions about how we can sync both contractors and customers together while improving on clarity. We're also starting to work on content strategy and designing a customer dashboard flow for users to manage their projects.
                           I'm continuing to iterate on these designs we continue to understand user needs better.</p>
