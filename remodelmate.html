                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">overview</h2>
                  <p>Remodelmate helps homeowners love where they live by connecting them with reliable, quality-driven contractors and
                      guiding and managing their project.
                      In November 2017, I joined the team to lead the product redesign and company rebrand to
                      make the customer-facing product flow more <span class="bold">intuitive, cohesive and ready for automation.</span>
                    </p>

                  <p>After understanding our user base the customer base,we were able to
                    sort out challenges and the main goal for the user:
                    <h4>How can we make the renovating process a transparent, approachable and frictionless experience? </h4>
                    </p>



                    <p>After speaking with Chad (founder) about product milestones and company performance, we outlined company goals
                        and metrics for success:
                        <h4>How can we increase user conversion through the online product rather than through calls?</h4>
                      </p>

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Team and My Role</h2>
                  <p>The team includes the founder/CEO, a developer and myself. I specifically work on product design/branding for Remodelmate including research, branding, wireframes, flows and hi-fi mockups.</p>

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>
                  <p>Starting off we decided to interview past and current customers to get an idea of what users of the website and
                      believers in the brand would be like. We also conducted interviews with people who have thought about Remodelmate but changed their mind.
                      We talked to 9 people to figure out what works, why it does and what gaps needed to be filled in the user flow.</p>
                      <h4 class="bold mini-subtitle">Who's our customer</h4>
                      <p>Based on Remodelmate's past revenue we found our target users are people middle-aged or higher with disposable or joint income, who either own a house, townhome or condo. After speaking with users, we found a couple of common painpoints:</p>
                          <ul>
                             <li>They don't have time to micromanage or attempt DIY major home projects.</li>
                             <li>They might be hesitant to trust contractors due past experiences of faulty work or incompleteness.</li>
                             <li>They needed more clarity of the project scope and Remodelmate's role.</li>
                            </ul>
                  <section>

                      </section>

                  <p>Based on these learnings we decided to approach the design with <span class="bold">clear communication, experiences to build trust
                      and ways for users to keep up with their project.</span></p>
                      </section>

                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Rethinking Brand Elements</h2>
                <p>One of the first things I worked on was refining the brand identity to compliment our target audience. We wanted to brand to be <span class="bold">clean, trustworthy and friendly</span>
                   as we found that customers within our target market were receptive to brand presences with those traits.</p>
                <p>We designed a color palette with a cool-toned green for an upbeat and professional primary color.
                    The original serif typeface used for the logo was switched out with a friendly and modern sans serif.
                    We kept the original mark of a house merged with a dog to reinforce that <span class="bold">friendly and loyal attitude</span>, and used the typeface throughout the rest of web layout
                    as it was both fitting to the brand a readable in copy.</p>

                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Designing a System from Scratch</h2>
                <p>A key part of beginning this project was defining styles and components to be used throughout the product. I did this early
                    on to help us think about how we planned to be consistent throughout the product to create recognizable patterns for users.
                    As we progressed through different parts of the product, we found it necessary to iterate on this.

                      <p>We broke down the process and how users interact with the product, starting from their initial search for
                          a contractor to project completion to find pain points or opportunites for engagement.</p>

                      <section class="case-text">
                      <h2 class="case-subtitle">Solutions</h2>
                      <p>After considering that many of our customers were being pulled into the product through media content on social media early in the flow,
                         I found an opportunity to engage them through content as soon as possible - leading to a gallery-like concept of different
                         projects completed through Remodelmate visible on the landing page. We call this <span class="bold">'Get Inspired', a case-study feature designed to
                            increase conversions on the site with an engaging and transparent looks into past completed projects.</span></p>


                        <p>Another opportunity I found to make the process more frictionless and users more likely to convert was
                          the process of submitting a request for a project. Instead of a regular form like before we want to allow users to be able
                          to 'build' as much of their project as they can in the shortest amount of steps possible. I decided to focus on what we call
                          <span class="bold">"Project Builder" to find ways of streamlining the path of requesting a project to generating an invoice and purchase.</span></p>


                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Sketches</h2>
                  <p>I started off sketching rough ideas for a simple, easy-to-use and modern layout for the website.

                      </section>
                      <p>Having a clean and open layout was important for clarity and ease-of-use, we planned to
                          approach redesign to be as concise as possible to meet the user needs of fully understanding the product.</p>

                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">Early Explorations and Iterations</h2>
                    <p>These are a few early iterations of the Get Inspired feature. Changes were made over time to improve usability, clarity
                      and consistency for users. <a href="index.html"><h2>See Iterations here</h2>

                <section class="case-text">
                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">Opening up to users with 'Get Inspired'</h2>
                    <p>We decided to increase transparency and build trust through an engaging experience of content -
                      featuring past client work done by Remodelmate before, complete with photos, videos,
                      time frames, pricing and contractor info. This was especially fitting as most customers
                      spoke of being pulled in by media content.

                      <p>The next main feature was the project builder. Using this feature customers can describe their project,
                          choose contractors within their budget and schedule and submit their request to begin renovating.
                          Users can see who's available and qualified for their needs instantly, as well as plan for multiple contractors.</p>

                        <p>One critical challenge of the Project Builder was collecting information in a way that would
                            be relevant for the customer and contractor while keeping automation of the platform in mind.
                            We started off with a list of project details a customer inputs and narrowed it down to what was absolutely necessary for
                            contractors to generate a quote.
                            After several explorations we found that quantifying different jobs (at the right of the screen) would execute this well.</p>

                        <p>To remain flexible and customer-centric, we made it possible for customers to input other information to give specific
                          details to their chosen contractor.</p>

                          <h2 class="case-subtitle">What About Multiple Contractors?</h2>
                          <p>One problem we encountered in Project Builder was the flow a user would take when their project needs more than one contractor to complete
                              (this is especially true for larger projects like a full room or home). We took a 'step-by-step' approach to keep the user in sync, by first notifying the user
                              of a need for multiple contractors and allowing them to select their contractor for each part of the project.</p>

                                   <li><span class="bold">Don't sacrifice clarity for simplicity -</span> Several of the first iterations lacked descriptions or other indicators to let users what part of the process they were in or what they could do. This proved problematic
                                        as people who knew little about Remodelmate had trouble understanding context.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Design guidelines are a must -</span> This allowed for quicker iterations with reusable components and helped maintain consistency throughout the design.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Sync up with other parts of the product -</span> It was important that we asked questions about how the design would work well from the engineering side and the contractor
                                       side. Certain trade-offs were necessary (like choosing to standardize job types to make sure that we could still automate quote generation.)</li>

                        <p>Moving forward we're continuing to ask questions about how we can sync both contractors and customers together while improving on clarity. We're also starting to work on content strategy and designing a customer dashboard flow for users to manage their projects.
                           I'm continuing to iterate on these designs we continue to understand user needs better.</p>
