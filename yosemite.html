                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">overview</h2>
                  <p>In late Feburary I traveled to Yosemite National Park for a design conference in the mountains - it was my first time ever going
                    this west and that high up! The conference hosted a desgin challenge in which one of the prompts was to design
                    a site layout to encourage more visitation and donation to Yosemite. I got started on this on the last day, so with about 6 hours to the deadline
                    I got started! Going into this I had one question in mind:
                    </p>

                    <h4>How can we make people more likely to give to a landmark?</h4>
                </section>
                  <!-- <section>

                      </section>
                  </section> -->

                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>
                  <p>With a short amount of time to plan and build, I jumped right into figuring out what compels people to give
                      and what project I could build (within a short timespan) to increase donations. I had brief conversations with anyone
                      I ran into at Yosemite, asking questions like "If you donate, wehre do you usualy donate? Why?" and "What about this cause
                      or organization compels you?". I also asked about their time at Yosemite and how they were enjoying the park.</p>
                      <h4 class="bold mini-subtitle">Key Findings</h4>
                      <p>After speaking to people visiting Yosemite I learned the following:</p>
                          <ul>
                             <li>People tend to donate to causes that affect them or a loved one personally</li>
                             <li>Newcomers to Yosemite</li>
                             <li>They needed more clarity of the project scope and Remodelmate's role.</li>
                            </ul>
                  <section>

                      </section>

                  <p>Based on these learnings we decided to approach the design with <span class="bold">clear communication, experiences to build trust
                      and ways for users to keep up with their project.</span></p>
                      </section>

                <section class="case-text">
                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Brand Elements</h2>
                <p>One of the first things we worked on was refining the brand identity to compliment our target audience. We wanted to brand to be <span class="bold">clean, trustworthy and friendly</span>
                   as we found that customers within our target market were receptive to brand presences with those traits.</pn>
                <p>We designed a color palette with a cool-toned green for an upbeat and professional primary color.
                    The original serif typeface used for the logo was switched out with a friendly and modern sans serif.
                    We kept the original mark of a house merged with a dog to reinforce that <span class="bold">friendly and loyal attitude</span>, and used the typeface throughout the rest of web layout
                    as it was both fitting to the brand a readable in copy.</p>

                    <section class="case-text">
                      <h2 class="case-subtitle">User Flows</h2>
                      <p>We broke down the process and how users interact with the product, starting from their initial search for
                          a contractor to project completion.</p>
                          <section>

                              </section>
                      <p>We also used the flows to find opportunities to improve usabilty and experience.
                          This included the 'Get Inspired' case-study feature as well as the Remodelmate 'Project Builder'.</p>
                            </section>


                <section class="case-text">
                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Sketches</h2>
                  <p>I started off sketching rough ideas for a simple, easy-to-use and modern layout for the website.
                      </p>

                      </section>
                      <p>Having a clean and open layout was important for clarity and ease-of-use, we planned to
                          approach redesign to be as concise as possible to meet the user needs of fully understanding the product.</p>
                            </section>




                <section class="case-text">
                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">Opening up to users with 'Get Inspired'</h2>
                    <p>We decided to increase transparency and build trust through an engaging experience of content -
                      featuring past client work done by Remodelmate before, complete with photos, videos,
                      time frames, pricing and contractor info. This was especially fitting as most customers
                      spoke of being pulled in by media content.

                      <p>The next main feature was the project builder. Using this feature customers can describe their project,
                          choose contractors within their budget and schedule and submit their request to begin renovating.
                          Users can see who's available and qualified for their needs instantly, as well as plan for multiple contractors.</p>

                        <p>One critical challenge of the Project Builder was collecting information in a way that would
                            be relevant for the customer and contractor while keeping automation of the platform in mind.
                            We started off with a list of project details a customer inputs and narrowed it down to what was absolutely necessary for
                            contractors to generate a quote.
                            After several explorations we found that quantifying different jobs (at the right of the screen) would execute this well.</p>

                        </section>
                        <p>To remain flexible and customer-centric, we made it possible for customers to input other information to give specific
                          details to their chosen contractor.</p>

                          <h2 class="case-subtitle">What About Multiple Contractors?</h2>
                          <p>One problem we encountered in Project Builder was the flow a user would take when their project needs more than one contractor to complete
                              (this is especially true for larger projects like a full room or home). We took a 'step-by-step' approach to keep the user in sync, by first notifying the user
                              of a need for multiple contractors and allowing them to select their contractor for each part of the project.</p>

                                <ul>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Don't sacrifice clarity for simplicity -</span> Several of the first iterations lacked descriptions or other indicators to let users what part of the process they were in or what they could do. This proved problematic
                                        as people who knew little about Remodelmate had trouble understanding context.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Design guidelines are a must -</span> This allowed for quicker iterations with reusable components and helped maintain consistency throughout the design.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Sync up with other parts of the product -</span> It was important that we asked questions about how the design would work well from the engineering side and the contractor
                                       side. Certain trade-offs were necessary (like choosing to standardize job types to make sure that we could still automate quote generation.)</li>

                                 </ul>

                        <h2 class="case-subtitle">What we're working on now</h2>
                        <p>Moving forward we're continuing to ask questions about how we can sync both contractors and customers together while improving on clarity. We're also starting to work on content strategy and designing a customer dashboard flow for users to manage their projects.
                           I'm continuing to iterate on these designs we continue to understand user needs better.</p>
