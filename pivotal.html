                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">overview</h2>
                  <p>Pivotal helps companies deliver exceptional user experiences through adoption of platform, tools and methodology. 
                    In summer of 2018 I joined Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the cloud-native platform that enables Pivotal's customor companies to build 
                    stable, secure software quickly, efficiently and at scale.
                   
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>I worked on Apps Manager, the web interface product that developers and operators use to manage and monitor apps that are deployed on Cloud Foundry.
                     My role was working directly with product management to explore opportunities to improve Apps manager through
                     research-driven product strategy. I also completed interaction and visual design for these solutions.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Problem</h2>
                  <p>Pivotal Cloud Foundry is expanding at a rapid pace - and so are the companies who run on it. While Apps Manager functionality expands just in time with PCF's growth and cudtomer needs,
                    it's user experience wasn't ideal for companies at scale. Finding and managing apps in a foundations containing a hundred to a thousand apps
                    became difficult for an interface that wasn't built for that much volume, so our challenge was to create a solution to help users navigate their foundation so that they can find the apps they need.
                      <h4>How much of a pain-point is the information architecture of AM? How does navigation help or impede user flows? How can we optimize this for current users?</h4>
                    </p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">Understanding Users</h2>
                  <p>While we knew that some parts of the information archetiecture affected user experience it was difficult to understand the experiences of our specific user group without doing more research into who used Apps Manager for what tasks.
                    After speaking with teams working on related products, user proxies and product management, we found that our users were split into two groups: developers and operators. </p>

                      <p>After understanding who was using Apps Manager, we focused our research by asking key questions about how they work, their painpoints and their needs.</p>
                          <ul>
                             <li>Whatâ€™s the most valuable use case for operators and developers?</li>

                  <p>Based on these learnings we decided to approach the design with <span class="bold">clear communication, experiences to build trust

                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Rethinking Brand Elements</h2>
                <p>One of the first things I worked on was refining the brand identity to compliment our target audience. We wanted to brand to be <span class="bold">clean, trustworthy and friendly</span>
                   as we found that customers within our target market were receptive to brand presences with those traits.</p>
                <p>We designed a color palette with a cool-toned green for an upbeat and professional primary color.
                    The original serif typeface used for the logo was switched out with a friendly and modern sans serif.
                    We kept the original mark of a house merged with a dog to reinforce that <span class="bold">friendly and loyal attitude</span>, and used the typeface throughout the rest of web layout
                    as it was both fitting to the brand a readable in copy.</p>

                      <p>We broke down the process and how users interact with the product, starting from their initial search for
                          a contractor to project completion to find pain points or opportunites for engagement.</p>

                      <section class="case-text">
                      <h2 class="case-subtitle">Solutions</h2>
                      <p>After considering that many of our customers were being pulled into the product through media content on social media early in the flow,
                         I found an opportunity to engage them through content as soon as possible - leading to a gallery-like concept of different
                         projects completed through Remodelmate visible on the landing page. We call this <span class="bold">'Get Inspired', a case-study feature designed to
                            increase conversions on the site with an engaging and transparent looks into past completed projects.</span></p>


                        <p>Another opportunity I found to make the process more frictionless and users more likely to convert was
                          the process of submitting a request for a project. Instead of a regular form like before we want to allow users to be able
                          to 'build' as much of their project as they can in the shortest amount of steps possible. I decided to focus on what we call
                          <span class="bold">"Project Builder" to find ways of streamlining the path of requesting a project to generating an invoice and purchase.</span></p>

                      <p>Having a clean and open layout was important for clarity and ease-of-use, we planned to

                            <p>A key part of beginning this project was defining styles and components to be used throughout the product. I did this early
                                on to help us think about how we planned to be consistent throughout the product to create recognizable patterns for users.
                                As we progressed through different parts of the product, we found it necessary to iterate on this.

                    <p>We decided to increase transparency and build trust through an engaging experience of content -
                      featuring past client work done by Remodelmate before, complete with photos, videos,
                      time frames, pricing and contractor info. This was especially fitting as most customers
                      spoke of being pulled in by media content.

                        <p>One critical challenge of the Project Builder was collecting information in a way that would
                            be relevant for the customer and contractor while keeping automation of the platform in mind.
                            We started off with a list of project details a customer inputs and narrowed it down to what was absolutely necessary for
                            contractors to generate a quote.
                            After several explorations we found that quantifying different jobs (at the right of the screen) would execute this well.</p>

                        <p>To remain flexible and customer-centric, we made it possible for customers to input other information to give specific

                          <p>One problem we encountered in Project Builder was the flow a user would take when their project needs more than one contractor to complete
                              (this is especially true for larger projects like a full room or home). We took a 'step-by-step' approach to keep the user in sync, by first notifying the user
                              of a need for multiple contractors and allowing them to select their contractor for each part of the project.</p>

                                   <li><span class="bold">Don't sacrifice clarity for simplicity -</span> Several of the first iterations lacked descriptions or other indicators to let users what part of the process they were in or what they could do. This proved problematic
                                        as people who knew little about Remodelmate had trouble understanding context.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Design guidelines are a must -</span> This allowed for quicker iterations with reusable components and helped maintain consistency throughout the design.</li>
                                   <li><span class="bold">Sync up with other parts of the product -</span> It was important that we asked questions about how the design would work well from the engineering side and the contractor
                                       side. Certain trade-offs were necessary (like choosing to standardize job types to make sure that we could still automate quote generation.)</li>

                                  <p>We've shown these designs to important stakeholders like customers as well as other members of the team. What was once just
                                    me and the CEO as expanding to us, a developer and marketer who were all brought on board after sharing these product changes.

                                      After majority of our designs were completed, the Chad went on to raise over $500,000 this Spring in Remodelmate's seed round by pitching to investors with these designs
                                      alone. </p>

                           I'm continuing to iterate on these designs we continue to understand user needs better.</p>
