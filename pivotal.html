                  <p>Pivotal helps companies deliver exceptional user experiences through adoption of platform, tools and methodology. 
                    In summer of 2018 I joined Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the cloud-native platform that enables Pivotal's customor companies to build 
                    stable, secure software quickly, efficiently and at scale.
                   
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>I worked on Apps Manager, the web interface product that developers and operators use to manage and monitor apps that are deployed on Cloud Foundry.
                     My role was working directly with product management to explore opportunities to improve Apps manager through
                     research-driven product strategy. I also completed interaction and visual design for these solutions.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Problem</h2>
                  <p>Pivotal Cloud Foundry is expanding at a rapid pace - and so are the companies who run on it. While Apps Manager functionality expands just in time with PCF's growth and cudtomer needs,
                    it's user experience wasn't ideal for companies at scale. Finding and managing apps in a foundations containing a hundred to a thousand apps
                    became difficult for an interface that wasn't built for that much volume, so our challenge was to create a solution to help users navigate their foundation so that they can find the apps they need.
                      <h4>How much of a pain-point is the information architecture of AM? How does navigation help or impede user flows? How can we optimize this for current users?</h4>
                    </p>

                  </h2>
                  <p>While we knew that some parts of the information archetiecture affected user experience it was difficult to understand the experiences of our specific user group without doing more research into who used Apps Manager for what tasks.
                    After speaking with teams working on related products, user proxies and product management, we found that our users were split into two groups: <span class="bold">app developers and app operators.</span> </p>

                      <p>After understanding who was using Apps Manager, we focused our research by asking key questions about how they work, their painpoints and their needs.</p>

                             <li>What’s the most valuable use case for operators and developers?</li>
                             <li>What are the current pain-points in these use-cases?</li>
                             <li>What are typical Apps Manager workflows?</li>

                <p>From each interview we gathered insights and painpoints, and converged on ones that were recurring throughout our

                        <p>We narrowed the problems we wanted to focus on by prioritizing them based on level of user pain-point and technical feasability.
                          After sorting, we then took the problems with the highest painpoints and highest feasbility and voted (in our product team) based on importance.

                        <p>In the end were able to isolate the most prevelant and important problems:

                          a solution concept.

                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">More to Learn</h2>
                    <p>We decided to increase transparency and build trust through an engaging experience of content -
                      featuring past client work done by Remodelmate before, complete with photos, videos,
                      time frames, pricing and contractor info. This was especially fitting as most customers
                      spoke of being pulled in by media content.
                      </p>
               
                    <section class="case-text">
                        <h2 class="case-subtitle">What we're working on now</h2>
                        <p>Moving forward we're continuing to ask questions about how we can sync both contractors and customers together while improving on clarity. We're also starting to work on content strategy and designing a customer dashboard flow for users to manage their projects.
                           I'm continuing to iterate on these designs we continue to understand user needs better.</p>
