            <h2 class="case-subtitle">Overview</h2>
              <p>Juice Earth Mama seeks to provide its customers with holistic and healthy products for people and their families to better their health. Since it's start, the founder noticed that customers don't use the site for purchase, information or help. They often have difficulty picking products right for them.
                  I redesigned their online experience so that they could pull in more orders and make it easy for anyone to start drinking healthy.

          <section class="case-text">
            <h2 class="case-subtitle">Research</h2>

                <p class="bold">Who's our customer?</p>
                <p>I asked Karen about her customer base, about who needed her product the most and who bought it more.After several brief interviews I could divide her customer base into a few main groups:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li> They have families or some kind of obligation</li>
                      <li> They want to make more nutritious choices or start a new diet </li>
                      <li> They don't have a lot of time to do so</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Her audience is driven by lifestyle changes, interesting tastes and wellness, so I started to design with those ideals in mind.

              <section class="case-text">
                <h2 class="case-subtitle">Wireframes</h2>
                <p>The <span class="bold">About</span> page was something that I decided to make drastic changes to by shortening the funding story into something easy to process and clear.
                  In most cases,  people want to see the product straightaway, so an option on the about page leads to a catalog.
                  Two key pages I included were the <span class="bold">Ingredients</span> page and the <span class="bold">Plans</span> page.
                  The <span class="bold">Plans</span> page would fix the problem of people not knowing what plan to buy.
                  The <span class="bold">Ingredients</span> page is more of a resource that is accessible by the navigation bar, as some people may not be too interested in the fine details of whats inside.

                <p>If I decide to build this project out or redesign some elements, some next steps include:
                  </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> Adding additional pages to the concept (more in-depth about page, payments page etc)</li>
                  <li> Doing customer research with more individuals from different groups</li>
                  <li> Finding a way to incorporate social media or blogging posts into the site</li>
                </ul>
